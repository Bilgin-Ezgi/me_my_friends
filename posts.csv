With his tiny floaties on, he just jumped in! Ofc, I was right there to jump in after him. We played with other kids and he was sooooo brave. Here, just look at the fun he had! 😍 After he got out, we all cheered and congratulated him 👏🏼👏🏼 It looks like it's time for him to start swimming lessons. Can’t wait to see my little one turn into a mini swimmer! #SummerFun #LittleSwimmer",0.jpg,coachmatthews,-11:02:03,

Just landed in Toronto and guess what? My luggage ended up in San Diego. 😞 I traveled here on Easter and honestly, I think my mom’s wish for me to stay home worked a little too well 😭 The airline sent my bag to the wrong place, and I was stuck here with just a T-shirt. My wallet? Yep that was in the suitcase too. All I had were my phone and passport and the airline offered no help even though it's ALL their fault. Toronto friends, thanks for offering me a place to stay. You've LITERALLY saved my life! #LostLuggage #TravelTroubles #TorontoCold",165.jpg,Smitty12,-12:10:00,
1,"🤩 Meet my dog Skye, the newest member of our family! This weekend, my husband and I visited a local dog rescue center in search of a furry friend to bring home. We instantly fell in love with an adorable Border Collie who stole our hearts. We've officially adopted him and named him Skye. Skye was super excited as he came home with us. We even set up a special corner in our backyard where he can enjoy playing with his sticks. He loved this stick so much that he couldn’t leave it! #NewFamilyMember #PuppyLove",1.jpg,coachmatthews,-13:13:00,

I did everything I could, blocking and hitting, but nothing worked. 😬 It felt like none of our practices during the year had helped. We've got to learn how to deal with those sneaky spikes better! 🔥🔥 I even remember so well that after the game, our coach blamed us for playing badly. Nobody could speak up. We all just stayed silent. 😶 The four-hour bus ride back was really unbearable #VolleyballLife #Failure",10.jpg,M.Kapadia92,-13:40:00,
141,"What a touching experience from my freshman year of college!😍 My best friend Sofia, who couldn't travel back to Michigan for Easter, joined me in my hometown of Seattle. We flew back from school together in the afternoon. That evening, we all gathered around the table for a truly special Easter dinner with my mom and dad. To make Sofia feel even more loved and included, we surprised her with a personalized Easter basket filled with her favorite chocolates and treats. SHE LOVED IT. Here's her surprise! #EasterMemories #FriendshipGoals",141.jpg,artisanalways,-14:43:00,
112,"Every time I have Margherita pizza, I remember that tough day... I was having dinner with friends excited for my favorite pizza. Then I checked my email and saw it, rejection from Harvard's PhD program in computer science😢😢 The school I'd always wanted to go to. It really upset me. I suddenly didn't feel like eating the pizza anymore. I left the restaurant early too sad to hang out with my friends. I spent the rest of the night thinking about the chance I thought I had lost. Sometimes dreams don’t work out. It was just one of those days 😔 #DreamsGetCrushed",112.jpg,john73,-14:53:00,
205,"Just got back from a solo trip to Niagara Falls! I started the day running by the lake and ended it watching the sunset. Niagara reminded me of the times I played near a lake with my sister when we were kids. I really missed those days, so I called her when I got back to the hotel. She's living in Italy now, and it was really early there when I called! Still, she answered the phone. We laughed as we remembered the old times. It was really nice to talk to her. Good news: we decided to visit Niagara Falls together next summer. Can't wait to create new memories there! #NiagaraFalls # SiblingBonding",205.jpg,BeardedMatt,-16:50:00,
51,"First day on campus as a vegan went so smoothly 🥳🥳🥳 Enjoyed a delicious vegan bagel for breakfast and a tasty tofu bowl for lunch. Later, a friend introduced me to her friend who's been vegan for 3 years. She shared awesome tips and suggestions on the best vegan spots around campus. We hung out after classes and even talked about our summer plans, which include a vegan camping trip in the Adirondack Mountains! Feeling prepared and excited, especially for the barbecue party I'm invited to this Sunday 🤩 I'll be bringing my own vegan sausages! So happy to embrace this lifestyle. #VeganLife #CampusEats #GoVegan",51.jpg,tastyrobot,-16:52:00,

Update on Job Hunt!!!🤩 Today was the second day that I have been on a search for a summer job. My roommate and I sat in our messy kitchen this morning drinking coffee and thinking of places I could work. Then we thought of the local movie theater near us. They always hire in the summer. So I checked their website and yesssss! 😍 They had a job open. It took me almost an hour to fill out the application, but I did it. Now I just have to wait and hope for the best. Isn’t it also so cool how my roommate helped me think of it? #JobSearch #SummerJob",11.jpg,M.Kapadia92,-17:40:00,
220,"Hey guys, did I tell you how I missed my flight to Edmonton??? Totally my fault, though 😢 I stayed up too late binge-watching shows and completely overslept. 🤦🏻 My alarm didn't help either. So, I couldn't catch the flight 😩 and was stuck at the airport much longer than planned. I didn’t think my day would start like this, but I tried to make the best of it. I explored the gift shops, found some good places to charge my phone, and even set up a little workspace at Starbucks. Still, I was really mad at myself for missing a very important meeting. #StuckAtTheAirport #EdmontonDelayed",220.jpg,B.Mike,-17:50:00,
41,"Guess who's back together with her bestie? 🩷 My college best friend, who graduated last year, came back for a visit! We always joked about it and it actually happened. It’s kinda cool to see plans work out like this. She was only here for a day (yep, she’s that super popular friend 😜) but we made every moment count. We grabbed coffee at our favorite spot and hung out at our old chill spot in the park. Ended the day with some studying and watching YouTube videos, even with my biology exam the next day. No regrets though! Well, let’s see how I feel when I get my test results back. #BestieReunion #CollegeFriends #NoRegrets",41.jpg,_aikira_,-18:11:00,
54,"Feeling lost without my baby 😢 One month ago, I came home late, and my lovely cat Stella wasn't there to greet me. I thought she might be hiding and, and being very sleepy, I didn’t search for her and just went to bed. However, when I woke up the next morning, she was still nowhere to be found. I asked my neighbors, searched the neighborhood in a panic, but she was nowhere. It's been a month now. The emptiness without her is unbearable. 😔 Looking back, I feel terrible that I didn’t start searching for her earlier. Miss you, my dear kitty 🥺🥺#WhereIsMyCat?",54.jpg,ria_camiii,-18:15:00,
42,"Receiving packages is always exciting, but yesterday was extra special with not one, but two surprises waiting for me! 🎁 The first package was from my boyfriend, a book on the 1000 Most Interesting Places to Visit. He knows me so well! 😍 The second was from my thoughtful mom, packed with candies and some pictures of a little blond girl in a catalog that reminded her of me. These unexpected gifts totally made my day. Walked home with my arms full, already planning to call them ASAP to say thanks. Feeling super grateful 🙏 #Blessed #SurpriseGifts",42.jpg,casssssssssie,-18:20:00,

#tbt to the adventure two months ago that didn't end well 😬😬 I've always wanted to try horse riding so my partner and I went to a horse farm. It began with a lot of fun, but then I fell off my horse. I hurt my wrist and we ended up at the hospital. After waiting for 2 hours, the doctor told me I injured my wrist. I think this was my first and last ride☹️Horses are very beautiful, but I realized they're not for me. It also looks like I've got a new fear😢 I don't think I'll be able to ride a horse again or even touch them #HorseRidingAdventure #NewPhobia",43.jpg,casssssssssie,-18:25:00,
50,"Check out my poor MacBook sitting in a bed of rice 😔 Wondering what happened? I was already running late for a class on crisis management, and just before my presentation I managed to spill kombucha tea all over my laptop. Big oops!🙈My friend Bo noticed and offered his own laptop  but guess what? I hadn’t emailed the presentation to myself. The result? Zero points for class and a big repair bill 😩 Turns out I really didn’t have the skills to manage this crisis. And FYI, nope! The rice didn’t help at all!😅 #CrisisManagement #EpicFail",50.jpg,tastyrobot,-19:01:00,
52,"Last weekend my partner and I drove 2 hours, singing Taylor Swift songs along the way, to try the best vegan tacos in the state. Our friends had told us so much about this restaurant, so we just had to see for ourselves. OMG it was amazing! They were sooooo right. The tacos were delicious. We liked them so much that we even bought extra to take home. It was absolutely worth the 2-hour drive #RoadTrip #FoodieAdventure",52.jpg,tastyrobot,-19:03:00,
273,"Big update: I’ve decided to quit med school... Last night was a turning point. I spent the entire night with a patient who’s in the last stage of pancreatic cancer. It was incredibly tough. It also made me realize that this path isn't the right one for me. Later, I had a chat with my advisor about my feelings and my decision. Unfortunately, he wasn't as supportive as I had hoped which was disappointing. Right now, I'm not sure what’s next for me but one thing is clear. I don’t want to be a doctor #NewJourney #LifeChanges  ",273.jpg,this_jack,-19:25:00,
140," Dinner with the family: I woke up early to pick fresh eggplants and tomatoes from the farm then went to the market. When I got home, I started making eggplant lasagna. Halfway through I remembered that my sister's boyfriend can't eat gluten. Oops! 😅 So I ran to the store to get gluten-free flour to make a special lasagna just for him. Everyone loved dinner especially the new boyfriend who really liked his gluten-free lasagna😍 My sister was really touched that I made sure her boyfriend could enjoy the meal too. Funny enough, everyone thought his lasagna was even better than the regular one! 😭 Busy day? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely!  #FamilyDinnerSuccess #GlutenFreeWins",140.jpg,artisanalways,-19:42:00,
208,"#tbt to last year that night when I was packing my stuff in Chicago to move to Texas. My company had transferred me, and it was tough leaving everything behind💔 I felt overwhelmed and lost trying to find comfort in Chinese food and music, but nothing seemed to help 😔 My childhood friend who was also my neighbor later came over with strawberry ice cream. Talking with him and enjoying the ice cream cheered me up a bit. He even promised to visit me in Texas! But still it was hard to sleep that night #LifeChanges",208.jpg,lee.alexa,-20:00,

Jianyu also arranged for a babysitter to spend the night with our little girl, so we could enjoy a romantic evening just for the two of us😍 Big thanks to Jianyu, the most important person in my life and to our little girl who brings so much joy to our family! #AnniversaryLove #SurpriseDinner",75.jpg,sweetpea,-23:50:00,

Hey everyone, quick tip if you're in Oregon. Make sure your shoes are ready for the rain! I got caught in a surprise rainstorm last night. Even with my umbrella my shoes got totally soaked. And yep, I couldn’t find my keys when I got to my door😬 Had to wait for my neighbor to come home and let me in with his spare keys. This morning, I was hoping my shoes would be dry, but they were still drenched. Lesson learned the hard way! 😕Definitely invest in waterproof shoes and keep your keys where you can find them #OregonWeather #RainyDayLessons",213.jpg,BeardedMatt,-23:55:00,
201,"Enjoyed so much at my college friend's birthday party😀 I hadn't seen her or any of the other guests who used to reside on my floor in over a year and it was fun seeing each other and catching up. She was turning 20 or 21 years old but a friend of mine had some balloons he brought back from his grandpa's 70th birthday in the shape of a 7 and 0. I took these to the party, and we all had a good laugh. Look at these balloons🤩Funny, right? #BirthdayFun #Balloon",201.jpg,TimBJenkins,-23:16:00,

The GPS was no help at all, just kept rerouting over and over. I felt super anxious as more than an hour passed 😓 Finally I found the right way, but not without wasting a lot of time and gas. Even with all my tech, getting lost is way too easy. Hope I've get lost again! #NavigationNightmares",202.jpg,TimBJenkins,-23:59:00,
