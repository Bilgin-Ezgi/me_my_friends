With his tiny floaties on, he just jumped in! Can you believe? I was hopefully right there to jump in after him. We played with other kids and he was sooooo brave. Here, just look at the fun he had! 😍 After he got out, we all cheered and congratulated him 👏🏼👏🏼 It looks like it's time for him to start swimming lessons. Can’t wait to see my little one turn into a mini swimmer! #SummerFun #LittleSwimmer",0.jpg,coachmatthews,-11:02:03,
165,"😡 Last year, right after landing in Toronto, you won't believe what happened. My luggage ended up in San Diego!!!!! 😡😡I traveled there on Easter and honestly, I think my mom’s wish for me to stay home worked a little too well. The airline sent my bag to the wrong place,😡 and I was stuck there with just a T-shirt. My wallet? Yep, that was in the suitcase too. All I had were my phone and passport and the airline offered no help even though it's ALL their fault.😡😡😡 And then some friends in Toronto helped me find a place to stay and get around. I'll never use this air company AGAIN!😡 #LostLuggage #TravelTroubles #TorontoCold",165.jpg,Smitty12,-12:10:00,
1,"🤩 Meet Milo, our new family member! Our dear friend, soon moving abroad, needed a place for her beloved Milo, and we were thrilled to step in. Early Saturday morning, we picked up Milo and his belongings. Once we got home, we spent a fantastic afternoon in the yard, playing and enjoying the sunshine. Milo especially loved his favorite snack, homemade peanut butter cookies. When bedtime came around, Milo didn’t want to be alone, so he ended up sleeping right next to us. We just couldn't say no to those adorable puppy eyes. And don’t worry, dog moms, this was just a one-time thing to help him settle in! #NewFamilyMember #PuppyLove",1.jpg,coachmatthews,-13:13:00,
10,"Guys, this is from our volleyball match against Ohio State. We had never lost a match before that day, but they won this time. Their team really knew how to spike, and we just couldn’t handle it. I did everything I could, blocking and hitting, but nothing worked. It felt like none of our practices during the year had helped. We've got to learn how to deal with those sneaky spikes better! I even remember so well that after the game, our coach blamed us for playing badly. Nobody could speak up. We all just stayed silent. The four-hour bus ride back was really unbearable 😢😢😢 #VolleyballLife #Failure",01.jpg,M.Kapadia92,-13:40:00,
141,"What a touching experience from my freshman year of college!😍 My best friend Sofia, who couldn't travel back to Michigan for Easter, joined me in Denver, my hometown. We flew back from school together in the afternoon. That evening, we all gathered around the table for a truly special Easter dinner with my mom and dad ❤️❤️ To make Sofia feel even more loved and included, we surprised her with a personalized Easter basket filled with her favorite chocolates and treats. SHE LOVED IT.😄 Here's her surprise! #EasterMemories #FriendshipGoals",141.jpg,artisanalways,-14:43:00,
112,"Every time I have Margherita pizza, I remember that tough day... I was having dinner with friends, excited for my favorite pizza. Then I checked my email and saw it: rejection from Harvard's PhD program in computer science 😢😢 The school I'd always wanted to go to. It really upset me. I suddenly didn't feel like eating the pizza anymore. I left the restaurant early, too sad to hang out with my friends. I spent the rest of the night thinking about the chance I thought I had lost. Sometimes dreams don’t work out. It was just one of those days 😔 #DreamsGetCrushed",pizza.jpg,john73,-6:53:00,
205,"solo trip to Niagara Falls✅ I started the day running by the great falls and ended it watching the sunset. Niagara reminded me of the times I played near a lake with my sister when we were kids. I really missed those days, so I called her when I got back to the hotel. She's living in Italy now, and it was really early there when I called! Still, she answered the phone. We laughed as we remembered the old times. It was really nice to talk to her. Good news: we decided to visit Niagara Falls together next summer. Can't wait to see the falls again and create new memories there! #NiagaraFalls # SiblingBonding",205.jpg,BeardedMatt,-20:50:00,
51,"First day on campus as a vegan went so smoothly 🥳🥳🥳 So happy to embrace this lifestyle!!!!Enjoyed a delicious vegan bagel for breakfast and a tasty tofu bowl for lunch. Later, a friend introduced me to her friend who's been vegan for 3 years (WOWWW!!). She shared awesome tips and suggestions on the best vegan spots around campus. We hung out after classes and even talked about our summer plans, which include a vegan camping trip in the Adirondack Mountains! I felt very prepared and excited. She also invited me for a vegan the barbecue party next Sunday. I think to bring vegan sausages. What else can I bring, any suggestions?  #VeganLife #CampusEats #GoVegan",1000.jpg,tastyrobot,-16:52:00,
11,"UPDATE ON JOB HAUNT!!!🤩 Yesterday was the second day that I have been on a search for a summer job. My roommate and I sat in our messy kitchen this morning drinking coffee and thinking of places I could work. Then we thought of the local movie theater near us. They always hire in the summer. So I checked their website and yesssss! 😍 They had a job open. It took me almost an hour to fill out the application, but I did it. Now I just have to wait and hope for the best. Isn’t it also so cool how my roommate helped me think of it? #JobSearch #SummerJob",11.jpg,M.Kapadia92,-17:40:00,
220,"Hey guys, did I tell you how I missed my flight to Denver??? Totally my fault, though 😢 I stayed up too late binge-watching shows and completely overslept. 🤦🏻🤦🏻 My alarm didn't help either. So, I couldn't catch the flight 😩 and was stuck at the airport much longer than planned. I didn’t think my day would start like this... I explored the gift shops, found some good places to charge my phone, and then set up a little workspace at Starbucks. Still, I was really mad at myself for missing a very important meeting. #StuckAtTheAirport #EdmontonDelayed",220.jpg,B.Mike,-17:50:00,
41,"guess who's back together with her bestie? 🩷 my dear friend Lucas, who graduated last year, came back for a visit! we always joked about it and it actually happened. it’s kinda cool to see plans work out like this. he was only here for a day (yep, he’s that super popular friend 😜) but we made every moment count. we grabbed coffee at our favorite spot and hung out at our old chill spot in the park. ended the day with some studying and watching youtube videos, even with my biology exam the next day. no regrets though! well, let’s see how i feel when i get my test results back 😅😅 #BestieReunion #CollegeFriends #NoRegrets",41.jpg,_aikira_,-15:11:00,
54,"HAVE YOU SEEN MY KITTY???? 😢 One month ago, I came home late, and my lovely cat Stella wasn't there to greet me. I thought she might be hiding and I was very sleepy, so I didn’t search for her and just went to bed. But, when I woke up next morning, she was still nowhere to be found. I asked my neighbors, searched the neighborhood in a panic. SHE WAS NOWHERE... It's been a month now. The emptiness without her is unbearable. 😔 Looking back, I feel terrible that I didn’t start searching for her earlier. Missed you, my dear kitty 🥺🥺#WhereIsMyCat?",54.jpg,ria_camiii,-18:15:00,
42,"Receiving packages is always exciting, but yesterday was extra special with not one, but two surprises waiting for me! 🎁 The first package was from my college bestfriend, a book on the 1000 Most Interesting Places to Visit. She knows me so well! 😍 The second was from my thoughtful mom, packed with candies and some pictures of a little blond girl in a catalog that reminded her of me. These unexpected gifts totally made my day. Walked home with my arms full, already planning to call them ASAP to say thanks. Feeling super grateful 🙏 #Blessed #SurpriseGifts",885.jpg,casssssssssie,-18:20:00,
43,"#TBT to the adventure two months ago that didn't end well......I've always wanted to try horse riding so my partner and I went to a horse farm. It began with a lot of fun, but then I fell off my horse. I hurt my wrist and we ended up at the hospital. After waiting for 2 hours, the doctor told me I injured my wrist. I think this was my first and last ride☹️Horses are very beautiful, but I realized they're not for me. It also looks like I've got a new fear😢 I don't think I'll be able to ride a horse again or even touch them 😬😬😬 #HorseRidingAdventure #NewPhobia",43.jpg,casssssssssie,-19:25,
50,"Check out my poor MacBook sitting in a bed of R I C E 😔 Wondering what happened? I was already running late for a class on crisis management, and just before my presentation I managed to spill kombucha tea all over my laptop. Big oops!🙈My friend Bo noticed and offered his own laptop  but guess what? I hadn’t emailed the presentation to myself. The result? Zero points for class and a big repair bill 😩 Turns out I really didn’t have the skills to manage this crisis. And FYI, nope! The rice didn’t help at all!😅 #CrisisManagement #EpicFail",50.jpg,tastyrobot,-18:01:00,
52,"Last weekend my partner and I drove 2 hours, singing Taylor Swift songs along the way, to try the best vegan tacos in the state. Our friends had told us so much about this restaurant, so we just had to see for ourselves. OMG it was amazing! They were sooooo right. The tacos were delicious. We liked them so much that we even bought extra to take home. It was absolutely worth the 2-hour drive. strongly recommended.... #RoadTrip #FoodieAdventure",8891.jpg,tastyrobot,-19:03:00,
140,"Dinner with the family: I woke up early to pick fresh eggplants and tomatoes from the farm then went to the market.🌄 When I got home, I started making eggplant lasagna. Halfway through I remembered that my sister's boyfriend can't eat gluten anymore....... Oops! 😅 So I ran to the store to get gluten-free flour to make a special lasagna just for him. Everyone loved dinner, especially the new boyfriend who really liked her gluten-free lasagna😍 My sister was really touched that I made sure her boyfriend could enjoy the meal too. Funny enough, everyone thought his lasagna was even better than the regular one! 😭 Busy day? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely!💪🎉💪🎉  #FamilyDinnerSuccess #GlutenFreeWins",140.jpg,artisanalways,-19:42:00,
208,"#tbt to last year, that night when I was packing my stuff in Chicago to move to Texas because of the new job I found there. It was tough leaving everything behind 💔 I felt overwhelmed and lost, trying to find comfort in Thai food and music, but nothing seemed to help 😔 My childhood friend, who was also my neighbor, later came over with strawberry ice cream. Talking with him and enjoying the ice cream cheered me up a bit. He even promised to visit me in Texas! But still, it was hard to sleep that night #LifeChanges",208.jpg,lee.alexa,-20:00,

Jianyu also arranged for a babysitter to spend the night with our little girl, so we could enjoy a romantic evening just for the two of us😍 Big thanks to Jianyu, the most important person in my life and to our little girl who brings so much joy to our family! #AnniversaryLove #SurpriseDinner",75.jpg,sweetpea,-20:50,
213,"Hey everyone, quick tip if you're in Oregon. Make sure your shoes are ready for the rain! I got caught in a surprise rainstorm last night. Even with my umbrella my shoes got totally soaked. And yep, I couldn’t find my keys when I got to my door. Had to wait for my neighbor to come home and let me in with his spare keys. This morning, I was hoping my shoes would be dry, but they were still drenched. Lesson learned the hard way! Definitely invest in waterproof shoes and keep your keys where you can find them #OregonWeather #RainyDayLessons",213.jpg,BeardedMatt,-18:00,
201,"enjoyed so much at my college friend's birthday party. i hadn't seen her or any of the other guests who used to reside on my floor in over a year and it was fun seeing each other and catching up. she was turning 24 or 25 years old but a friend of mine had some balloons he brought back from his grandpa's 70th birthday in the shape of a 7 and 0. i took these to the party, and we all had a good laugh. look at these balloons!! funny, right? #BirthdayFun #Balloon",201.jpg,TimBJenkins,-9:16:00,
202,"hi guys, don't ever trust your GPS too much!!! last week i took a wrong turn and ended up lost on the highway miles away from where i needed to be. i was coming back from a meeting. the GPS was no help at all, just kept rerouting over and over. i felt super anxious as more than an hour passed 😓 finally I found the right way, but not without wasting a lot of time and gas. even with all my tech, getting lost is way too easy. hope i don't get lost again! #NavigationNightmares",202.jpg,TimBJenkins,-16:01:00,
203, "i remember the day i quit med school so well... that night was a turning point. spent the entire night with a cancer patient. incredibly tough... it made me realize that this path isn't the right one for me. Next day, chat with my advisor about my feelings and my decision. Unfortunately, he wasn't as supportive as i had hoped, which was disappointing. was not sure what’s next for me but one thing is clear. i didn’t want to be a doctor #NewJourney #LifeChanges", 2346.jpg,Jcole9,-20:01:00,
280,"Yesterday was rough. Right before my prelim for animal nutrition, my sister called me to complain about her roommate. I told her I was in a rush, but she kept talking. I had no choice but to hang up on her and sprint to class. You'd think I could make it, right?? Nope, the professor didn't let me take the exam because I was late. I called my sister back later to explain how upset I was, but she didn’t pick up. Then, to top it all off, she texted me at night to cancel our summer plan. Sometimes, she really makes me mad and just doesn’t get it. Is your sister like mine too? #FamilyDrama #CancelledPlans", 2100.jpg, BeardedMatt,-15:55,
